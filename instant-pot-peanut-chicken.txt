Instant Pot Peanut Chicken

About 6 servings.

Ingredients:

- 1.5 lb chicken breast
- 3 fat cloves garlic, rough chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, chopped
- 1 teaspoon oil
- 13.5 oz can of coconut milk (liquid and solids)
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce (or use GF liquid amino acids)
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 tablespoon chili garlic paste (or sriracha)
- 1/2 cup peanut butter (or almond butter)

Instructions:
- Cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes, sprinkle with salt and set aside.
- If using an Instant Pot, set it to the sauté function, and sauté the ginger and garlic in a teaspoon of oil for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
- Add the coconut milk, soy sauce, honey, lime juice, chili paste and the chicken, everything except the peanut butter in the pot, and stir.
- Drop the peanut butter in spoonfuls over top of the chicken (don’t stir it in).
- Set to HIGH Pressure, for 9 minutes. Naturally release. See notes. (If using thigh meat pressure cook for 12 minutes.)
- If the sauce seems too thin, reduce a bit using the sauté function ( while constantly stirring, to prevent burning the bottom).

Notes:
- Stirring in the peanut butter after the chicken is cooked, or dropping it on the top of the chicken will prevent the sauce from getting too thick at the bottom of the instant pot which can cause a mild scorching.  So drop it on top, or add it after you release the pressure.
